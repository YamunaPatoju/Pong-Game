PONG GAME
A classic Pong game built using Python's turtle module. Two players control paddles to bounce the ball back and forth. If a player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point. The game continues indefinitely until the player closes the window.

HOW IT WORKS:
1.The game window opens with two paddles and a ball.
2.Players use their controls to move the paddles up and down.
3.The ball moves automatically, bouncing off walls and paddles.
4.If the ball passes a paddle, the opposing player earns a point.
5.The ball resets after each point, and the game continues.

FEATURES:
-Two-player gameplay
-Real time ball movement
-Detects and responds to collisions with walls and paddles.
-The ball resets its position after each point, keeping the game continuous.
